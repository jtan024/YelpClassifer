"""Great place to hang out after work: the prices are decent, and the ambience is fun. It's a bit loud, but very lively. The staff is friendly, and the food is good. They have a good selection of drinks.""",price
"""Went here with visiting family members and wanted them to try Indo and Singaporean food for the first time. Inside it's small and clean. We ordered 3 Laksa Mee and 3 plates of the roasted chicken with coconut rice. The food came out within 10 minutes. All 6 dishes, which made us think they pre-cooked the food in advance. It has to be. So here's the verdict. The Laksa Mee is really good. It's has a mild spicy flavor which did nothing for me so I ended up eating 10 teaspoons of the pepper sauce. However, it was spicy for my mom though she can't handle spicy food. It's $10.99 and has coconut based curry.  It kinda taste like a water-down Thai red curry or the Japanese miso tonkatsu ramen. The Laksa Mee portion was good; a big bowl with 2 shrimps, an egg and plenty of ramen noodle. Similar to ramen but not as salty. The roasted rice dish I didn't try but the ones ordering it love it. My picky uncle loves it too! Overall, I like the food and will dined here again. One thing I didn't like was the two waitresses keep looking at us. I know it wasn't intentional but they both stood there and keep looking and staring at us eating. It made my mom and I very uncomfortable. Or maybe it's because I'm just soo damn good-looking and irresistible?? LOL""",price
"""One of the few good things that I have experienced during COVID19 outbreak was discovering about this place. I love korean chicken and there are few other places that I usually go. Unfortunately most of them are currently closed so I decided to give this place a try. I can't believe I have never tried here before. It beats out all other joints around here even when you are getting it delivered. Their chicken burger is even better than Pop-eyes honestly. I can't wait until everything opens up again so that I can dine in. As for delivery, it came with everything neatly packaged and with well preserved crispiness of the chicken. One thing that put me off a little bit was the fact that I had to call twice because their phone line was busy. Its understandable since they must be getting a lot of business theses days so make sure you call more than once if they are not able to answer.""",food
"""Alhambra location has a drive thru! But it's always packed now with the covid-19. I called ahead and got my order really fast. Phone call orders are 5 drinks minimum though.""",service
"""Open during the quarantine with social distancing markers on the ground, free hand sanitizer and they even wipe down the Clover payment system between each customer. The workers were also actively trying to keep their distance when taking your order. Unfortunately, they ran out of beef by the time we visited. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Pita. It looked small and I was afraid that I wouldn't be full but it was enough food. The chicken was tender and there wasn't a dry bite at all. The flavor by itself is pretty good but tasted a lot better with the hot sauce. It has a little kick but it's mostly a sweet sauce. I also got to try the Lemon Cream Chop Fries, which had some bomb ass sauce! Seriously, the best part of the dish. I loved the tanginess but for what it is, it's hard for me to justify the price. The fried chicken was cooked nicely though. Will be back to try the beef dishes!""",service
"""Favorite Shawarma place in San Diego.  Covid update: Still open and serving.  Order though Door Dash is advised. A little food truck on the corner of Grape and Fern street Shwarama guys serves up a tasty menu of delicious Shwarama. Their menu is limited and if you go late in the day some items can be sold out. The wait can be long for you food as well.  There is some outdoor seating but again it is limited.  Just plan on getting your food to go. For all the downsides the food makes this place worth it.  The meet is delicious and flavorful. The rice has a nice consistency and the hummus is very tasty.  I always get the beef and I'm never disappointed. Overall, this is a great meal and you should give it a try!""",food
"""The five-star food is only enhanced by the six-star service (too corny?). I've only had the Actually Spicy (tuna, salmon, albacore; actually spicy) here and it has never let me down. Like all good places, I always say I will try something new next time... and like all good places, I always end up getting the same thing. The fish is always very fresh and flavorful - no complaints and really nothing to add here. The heat level is excellent in Actually Spicy (and noticeably spicier than the Mild Spicy, based on the free samples given out... more on this later). The spiciness isn't overwhelming and complements the fishiness perfectly. I also love that the vegetables included are seaweed salad and baby greens / spinach (vs. iceberg or something less nutritious). There are also jalapenos sprinkled in throughout, along with a helping of ginger on the side. The purple rice is delicious and my preference. Now onto the customer service. Every time you go, they always offer you a free soft drink. It is a small gesture by Pisces, but this kind of thing goes a long way and is emblazoned in people's memories. Even better than the soft drink, they always ask if you'd like to sample any food. Going beyond the extra dollop of free food, this sample was actually productive, as it helped me choose between Actually Spicy and Mild Spicy. Now that I am a regular customer, I rarely take the free sample, but the fact that they always offer it is exceptional. Every employee is extraordinarily welcoming and helpful. Josh, the owner (I think?), is always there helping prepare the food and teaching his staff. I overhead him once explaining something to a seemingly new employee in a very productive and Socratic way. The last time we ordered (during quarantine), Josh brought the food out himself and thanked us for supporting him during the lockdown. Great guy. The parking lot is pretty sizable and I've never had issues finding parking. The prices are in line with what you'd expect for a quality poke place ($15 per plate).""",food
"""Visited during the Covid Pandemic. You have the option of ordering online or calling in. I just called in because I was already at the door. They bring your order to you at the door. Call in process was very smooth and straight forward. Menus are posted on the door. Banh Mi hit the spot. It was warm - which not all Banh Mi places you get warm sandwiches. The sandwich was crispy but not dry, cucumbers in the sandwich was refreshing. Jalepenos were a nice touch - a good banh mi over all. Banh Mi Bro's has the Thai Tea formula down - I think they have one of the best in town. I have to be honest, sometimes I swing by just to get a Thai Tea. Milk Tea is delicious as well. The large drinks are 24 oz, compared to other places - the price for your drink is great! Def recommend. Thank you Banh Mi Bro's for taking precautions for public safety during this time!""",service
"""This place is cheap and yummy. My friends' mom works here, and her employees are kind even tho they dont know much English. They will always try to get what food you want. So this is how you order when you arrive at Lu's Garden, must wait in line to get service. Then you must pick your items depending on what you want to eat by the way you can get two, three, or four items, but they are different prices. i would recommend getting more items if you are hungry because this will fill you up for a while. After ordering the food, you must pay first, then sit anywhere, and bring your food and porridge. The porridge there is fantastic too because you get unlimited porridge, and it does not cost extra. They offer free tea too!!! When you finish eating, you can go home. The restaurant looks like a basic Asian restaurant, but i like that a lot. The parking here is terrible because other restaurants surround it, so be aware and park in the Sg supermarket.""",service
"""During the pandemic, a good boba is all I need to calm myself down. 7 Leaves are my go-to boba shop. I love how milky and sweet the drinks are. The boba is just the right texture as well; not too chewy and not too hard. The quality of both the boba and the tea is absolutely insane. The price of the boba is totally affordable as well. """,food
"""Was craving some dim sum so got me a little snack. So glad this restaurant does take out orders only so there wasn't much of a wait. The best part about this place is that Dim sum is served by single item orders which is perfect for an option to taste all variety.""",service
"""This boba shop is one of my favorite out of the bunch. Although it could be a bit sweet and heavy, the drinks always satisfy the boba cravings. They make drinks quick and efficient. What I like most about them is their warm boba. They're a bit pricey; almost as much as a meal. But you get what you pay for!""",food
"""This is an awesome donut shop run by the friendliest husband and wife team you'll ever meet. The donuts are always fresh and the service is always friendly. My sons love the maple bars, and my wife enjoys their apple fritters. Our family favorite has to be the croissant sandwiches though. We mostly get the sausage and egg, but have also gotten the bacon and egg. Overall an excellent place to get donuts and sandwiches.""",service
"""Kind and helpful customer service and hassle-free delivery during COVID-19. All of the food was packaged very presentably and tasted very fresh. They even threw in 3 chopstick helpers for my 3 young kids.""",service
"""I'm pretty mad with you running chicks, it's going to be a LONG while before I give you guys another shot.""",none
"""It's tasty no doubt, but after twenty wings I felt that it was more about the sauce than the chicken .. and that doesn't work for me. But they're nice folks, so it wasn't the worst experience in the world and it was comfortable to sit in here. Overall, subpar but pricey chicken wings.""",ambience
"""My mom and I found his place while shopping at the Nijiya market next door. The aroma of the buns were so enticing we had to find out where it was coming from. The shop is very small and very easy to miss as it's right next door to a bakery. The girl working that day suggested we try the Coffee bun as it was our first time, so we both bought one for each of us. My mom devoured it on the way home, and she hates coffee, but absolutely loved the buttery coffee flavor of these buns. We'll definitely be back soon to get more and also try their other flavors.""",food
"""Good option for casual seafood in the area. More pub like than the fancy restaurants nearby in North End. I opted for the fish and chips. The fish is very flaky and light and not greasy at all. The fries were more like seasoned steak fries which were also very good. Service was friendly and attentive at the bar. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area and looking for a low key meal.""",food
"""Holy cow. Second week in a row to get these delivered to my house and I can't believe how good these are! They have new flavors every week and the cookies are humongous. It literally took us a week to finish the last 4. Highly recommend this place. So so so delicious""",food
"""These are seriously the best cookies that I've ever had, better even than Insomnia cookie in Miami. The ice cream sandwiches are just ridiculous - you can pick any 2 cookies (or brownies) and then pick your ice cream. I opted for a chocolate chip cookie, a strawberry cheesecake cookie with the blackberry crumble ice cream. Just perfect for cheat day! Oh, and the service is just as great as their food!""",food
